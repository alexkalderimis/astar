# A\* in Haskell

This is a data-structure independent implementation of A\* search. All the hard work has been done by Cale Gibbard, the port to [`psqueues`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/psqueues) has been donated by Johannes Wei√ü.

The is currently _not_ the official repository but as there was no official repository documented, I created this one.
